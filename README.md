My son loves stories. Every evening he chooses a book, and we read it aloud before sleeping.

And it is never the book my daughter wants to hear. So she is choosing her book, and we read it as well. Lately, each book inspires a conversation. Why does the lion love strawberries while sausages are so much better? Mmm, an excellent question. 

One day I thought it would be helpful to bring a book about financial management basics because we have these talks sometimes - why mum can't stay home with me and needs to work?

Let's use AI to create a book for my children with the content I want.

With all these great tools around It took me a few hours to create a short story. We read it together at night, and it was a total success. The next day my daughter asked me to reread this story. But my son wasn't interested. Until I switched something in the story - now, instead of a bicycle, the girl in the story saved money for a new game console. Oh, here, I got all his attention! But now, the images in the book don't fit the storyâ€¦

Long story short, it came out as a small app that got our prompt (we are creating it together with both kids, everyone has their own details to add) and made a short book with the story and images. A few minutes of creative work and we have an original story every evening - our story to talk about.

Automatic created book - theFishBook.pdf

After checking all my options (API Access, etc.) I used the following products::
Google Cloud Vertex AI- text-to-image model - open-sourced Stable Diffusion deployed for online prediction.
Google Cloud Generative AI Studio - text-to-text capabilities - ready-to-use API/SDK access.
And a few Python lines to get it all together and create an HTML/PDF output that we can read together.
